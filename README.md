A collection of simple and practical scripts to simplify some tasks.

### Installation

To install any script, move it to a directory in your PATH:

>Replace `script_name` with the actual script name you want to install.

```bash
sudo mv script_name.sh /usr/local/bin/script_name
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/script_name
```
You can now run the script from anywhere using:

```bash
script_name
```
##### OR

Alternatively, clone the whole repository and move/rename the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chewbaqa/some-useful-scripts.git
